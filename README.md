# 12V-lead-acid-battery-level-indicator
This is a project i created using an lm324 quad opamp, where I used the opamps as comparators to light leds to indicate the battery SOC.
i later created an acryllic panel onto which the pcb can be mounted and the leds ligt to indicate the batt SOC.
The pcb is for a 12v lead acid battery but you can adjust the resitors to use it on any lead acid battery.
note i have said lead acid battery because a Li-ion battery SOC is not easily determined by the battery voltage.
i have posted a zip containing the kicad files and autodesk inventor files for easier editing compared to me sending a step file.
